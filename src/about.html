                    <p>'LOOKIN' meditation app has born with the idea to help people to get engaged in a meditative state of mind helping relieve stress and anxiety caused by our routine activities and overthinking.</p>
                    <p>The application is very simple to use, you just have to download on your phone, sign up and start enjoying the 30 days trial.</p>
                    <p>The audios available on the app are all guided meditations and are divided into <a href="/meditation/types">4 categories</a>: inner peace, love, confidence, and yin-yang. The recorded length takes about 5 to 30 minutes and there is an option to download if you'd like to listen to them on a flight mode for example.</p>
                    <p>As much more you practice meditation, the better you become, therefore, we suggest you take the advantage of the favorites feature to access your most liked meditations anywhere, anytime.</p>
                    <p>Enjoy your time <a href="/trial">meditating with us</a> and always remember to 'look in' yourself.</p>
