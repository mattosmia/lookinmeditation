                    <p>The purpose of meditation is to relax the mind, calming down the brain waves and having less thoughts. This can be achieved through breathing exercises or by starting to pay attention to one thing at time. This can also be called a stage of contemplation and one could say that thatâ€™s the first step to get beyond the analytical mind.</p>

Meditation helps to improve focus, and when we are more focused, we are automatically more productive. It also helps us to be calmer and to relieve stress.</p>
